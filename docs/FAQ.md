# FAQ

This document contains answers for the most frequently asked questions about [mojo.js](https://mojojs.org).

### What about backwards compatibility?

We strictly follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org) for all changes. New features can however be marked as
experimental to explicitly exclude them from the rules. This gives us the necessary freedom to ensure a healthy future
for [mojo.js](https://mojojs.org). So, as long as you are not using anything marked experimental, untested or
undocumented, you can always count on backwards compatibility, everything else would be considered a bug. However, to
completely avoid any risk of accidental breakage, we do recommend following current best practices for version pinning
with `package-lock.json` files.
