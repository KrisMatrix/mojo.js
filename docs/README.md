# The mojo.js Documentation

While the project itself is slowly stabilising, work on the documentation has only just begun, and it is still very much
a **work in progress**. But we are aiming for the same level of quality and coverage as the
[Mojolicious documentation](https://docs.mojolicious.org).

## Guides

* (Introduction)[Introduction.md]

A quick and fun introduction to the basic concepts of [mojo.js](https://mojojs.org).

* (Client)[Client.md]

How to use the full featured HTTP and WebSocket user agent that ships with the mojo.js framework.
